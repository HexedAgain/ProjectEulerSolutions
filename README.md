# ProjectEulerSolutions

My long term intention with this one is to publish this as a library that can be imported into a jetpack compose multiplatform
project. I envisage being able to display the solutions (and their text / images and such). As well as providing a means
to tinker with a problem (all solutions should implement NoArgument so that you can just hit a button and solve it
whilst other interfaces would allow for using custom inputs). Would also be nice to come up with a way of importing
libraries from other languages and then comparing execution times. Might find something else to chew on before ever
finishing this.

As per the Project Euler rules I will only be publishing the first 100 solutions here (and I haven't solved that many
yet :) )
Note to self, follow on solutions should really exist in another project (maybe it will include this one), one that won't
be made public.
